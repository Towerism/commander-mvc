# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This might mean generating issues, contributing to
feature discussions, fixing up confusing documentation, and more. Your help
would be greatly appreciated!

## New Features

Check the issues to see if there are any feature requests you'd like to start a
pull request for. If there isn't already an issue, feel free to make one to
propose the feature.

## Bugs

If you find any bugs, don't hesitate to create an issue for it. Be sure to check
to make sure no one has already reported it.

## Documentation

If you find any typos in the documentation or find that the documentation is
confusing (including this document!), please feel free to create an issue or
submit a pull request directly.

## Committing

This project uses 
[angular style commit messages](https://gist.github.com/stephenparish/9941e89d80e2bc58a153) 
in order to calculate next version when deploying as well as to generate
release notes. Use `npm run commit` in order to help structure your commit
according to these conventions.
